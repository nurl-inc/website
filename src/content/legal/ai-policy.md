# AI Policy

> Nurl is committed to building AI-free tools for tabletop role-playing games.

Once upon a time, humans created the world we live in today through imagination, innovation, and hard work. Today, we live in a world where AI is rapidly changing everything. Humans are no longer the sole creators of content.

Before we outline our commitments, let's first understand the history of AI.

## History of AI - It's not a new concept

Artificial intelligence (AI) began in the 1950s when researchers like Alan Turing and John McCarthy asked whether machines could “think,” leading to the first symbolic programs and the 1956 Dartmouth conference that coined the term “AI.” Early successes with rule‐based “expert systems” in the 1970s and ’80s gave way to periods of reduced funding (“AI winters”) when progress stalled, but advances in machine learning (particularly neural networks) revived interest in the 2000s.

Well before the public explosion of AI chatbots and generative tools, everyday smartphone features like autocorrect, predictive text, face recognition in photos, and voice assistants (e.g., Siri) were powered by smaller-scale machine learning models running locally or in the cloud, giving millions of users a taste of AI’s power long before it became widely visible in apps like AI-powered art generators and conversational agents. Over time, improvements in algorithms, data, and computing power have combined to make today’s sophisticated AI services possible.

To put it simply, if you have ever used autocorrect, predictive text, face recognition in photos, or voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant), you have used AI. So, in a way, we have all been using (and supporting) AI technology for years.

## Our Commitment

As a company committed to human creativity and ingenuity, we choose to draw a hard line against AI replacing human creativity. We believe that true innovation comes from human imagination, experience, and collaboration.

> We commit to never building AI-powered tools, features, or products. By all means, we are a "Human Made" software company.

We do not support the use of generated content that replaces the work of human creators. This is and has always been what makes the creative industry unique and powerful.

We hope that this policy will help to ensure that the TTRPG industry remains a place where human creativity and ingenuity are valued and celebrated.
