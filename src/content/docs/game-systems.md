# Game Systems

## Overview

Game systems are a way to create, validate, and test your own game mechanics. Each repository can contain a single game system.

For example, D&D 5e would be it's own repository. Within that repository, you would have all of the core rules, player's handbook, monster manual, etc. Those items would reference the associated game system of the repository.

In Nurl Sanctum, we simplify and enhance the process of creating and extending game systems through our licensing system. This means you can associate an existing game system with your repository and have access to the mechanics and rules of that game system. Likewise, you can extend (for fork) that game system to build on top of it.

If you would like to create your own game system, you can do so by first [creating a license](./creating-a-license.md) to associate with it.

## Creating a new game system

> Note: Only members of the Professional plan or higher can create game systems due to the requirement of associating a custom license with the game system.

### Create a new repository

To create a (custom) game system, you need to first [create a new repository](https://nurlttrpg.com/docs/repository-management). This will provide the dedicated space for all content related to the game that will use the system.

### Create a custom license

Next, you need to [create a license](./creating-a-license.md) to associate with the game system. This allows Sanctum to ensure you are covering your own intellectual property rights to protect your game system.

### Create the game system

Once you have created the repository and license, you can create the game system. This will be the shared component blocks used within all your game system content within the repository.

Click the "Create Game System" button in the repository to create the game system.
