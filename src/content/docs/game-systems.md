# Game Systems

## Overview

Game systems are a way to create, validate, and test your own game mechanics. Each repository can contain multiple game systems. To put it simply, a game system is like a module or book within a larger system (i.e. repository).

For example, D&D 5e would be it's own repository. Within that repository, you would have all of the core rules, player's handbook, monster manual, etc. Each of those "modules" is a game system.

In Nurl Sanctum, we simplify and enhance the process of creating and extending game systems through our [publisher verification system](https://nurlttrpg.com/docs/publisher-verification) which validates what you can do based on your publisher's license.

### Creating vs. Extending

When it comes to creating a game system, you have two options depending on if you are associated with a verified publisher workspace or not.

#### Verified Publisher Options

All verified publishers can utilize the following benefits:

- **Create new game systems.** This means you own the IP and essentially have full control over the game system.
- **Extend existing game systems.** This means you can use the mechanics and rules of an existing game system you have access to, but you can also add your own mechanics and rules to it if the license allows.
- **Confirm extended game systems.** This means you will be notified when someone extends your game system in Nurl Sanctum and you can approve or reject the changes.

Not only does this empower you to create and extend game systems faster, but it also allows you to control the "official" or "unofficial" content that is available to the public.

#### Non-Verified Publisher

Non-verified publishers can only extend existing game systems. This means you can use the mechanics and rules of an existing game system if the license allows.

> Nurl Sanctum makes understanding the license easier by providing a license summary for each game system and automatically checking if you have permission to extend the game system.

## Creating a Game System

To create a game system, you need to first [create a new repository](https://nurlttrpg.com/docs/repository-management).

Once you have a repository, and have navigated to it's dashboard, you can create a game system by clicking the "Create Game System" button located in the "Game Systems" section.

Clicking the button will take you to a form where you can fill in the details of the game system. If you are not associated with a verified publisher, you will will see a form that allows you to extend an existing game system.
