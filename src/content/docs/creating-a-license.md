# Creating a License

Licenses are a way to manage the usage of your game systems. Each license is associated with an organization or game system.

> [!NOTE]
> While Nurl Sanctum allows helps you to manage licenses, we are not a license management company. We always recommend using a legal counsel to help you establish your license agreements first.

## Overview

To create a license, click the "Create License" button. This will take you to the license creation page.

Here you will be able to create a new license to associate with your game system. You will need to provide the general information for the license:

## Required Fields

- **License Name** - The name of the license.
- **License Summary** - An easy to understand summary of the license.
- **Version** - The version of the license.
- **Status** - The status of the license. This can be "Draft" or "Published".

## Optional Fields

- **Source URL** - A URL to the source of the license.
- **Full Text** - The full text of the license.
- **Assets** - Any assets associated with the license.

Once you have provided the general information for the license, click the "save" button to create the license and redirect you back to the licenses page.

## License Permissions & Restrictions

Creating a license does not automatically create the permissions and restrictions for the license. You will need to [create them manually](./managing-permissions-and-restrictions).

## Making the License Available to All Game Systems

Once you update the license status to "Published", the license will be available to all game systems to use on Nurl Sanctum.
