# Collaborators

Collaborators are users who have access to a repository. They can be added by the repository owner and can have different levels of access to the repository.

## Accessing Collaborators

To access collaborators, navigate to the repository dashboard and click the "Collaborators" link in the left sidebar.

Collaborators are all the users who have access to your workspace. Each collaborator by default has access to the internal or public repositories within the workspace they are added to.

To learn more about managing workspace members, please refer to the [workspace members](https://nurlttrpg.com/docs/managing-workspace-members) documentation.
