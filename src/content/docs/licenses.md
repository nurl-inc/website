# Licenses

Licenses are a way to manage the usage of your game systems. Each license is associated with a verified publisher.

> [!NOTE]
> While Nurl Sanctum allows helps you to manage licenses, we are not a license management company. We always recommend using a legal counsel to help you establish your license agreements first.

## Overview

Depending on if you are associated with a verified publisher or not, you will have different options available to you when it comes to managing licenses.

### Verified Publisher

If you are associated with a verified publisher, you will be able to create, claim ownership, and manage licenses for your game systems.

### Unverified Publisher

If you are not associated with a verified publisher, you will be able to use licenses to extend game systems, but you will not be able to create your own game systems.

## Viewing Licenses

On your dashboard, you will see a "Licenses" section on the left sidebar. Here you will be able to create, claim, and manage licenses for your game systems.

Click the "Licenses" link to navigate to the licenses page. Here you will see a list of licenses that you have created, claimed, or are associated with.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are not associated with a verified publisher account, you will not see the "Licenses" section on the left sidebar.

## License Permissions & Restrictions

### License Permissions

Nurl Sanctum provides two unique features that allow you to control the permissions and restrictions of a license.

This means that you can control what users can and cannot do with the license.

This is a great way to help users understand what they are allowed to do with the license without needing to understand the legal jargon often associated with licenses.

### License Restrictions

Additionally, you can add restrictions to a license to control what users should not do with the license. Just like the permissions, this is a great way to help users understand what they are allowed to do with the license without needing to understand the legal jargon often associated with licenses.

## License Versioning

Another unique feature of Nurl Sanctum is the ability to version licenses in a accountable way. This means that each time you update a permission or restriction without changing the license version, Nurl Sanctum will show that the license version is now outdated with a warning message.

Once you update the license version, Nurl Sanctum will remove the warning and the license will be up to date.

## Licenses and Game Systems

When you utilize Nurl Sanctum to manage your licenses, you will gain extra features and benefits.

### Game System Access

When you create a license, it will be utilized in the Nurl Sanctum "License Assistant" feature. This feature allows users that are creating or extending a game system to understand the license requirements and restrictions in a streamlined and user friendly manner.

### Game Extension Accountability

When a user extends a game system, Nurl Sanctum will automatically validate which license should be used and if the system allows for the system or it's related works to be extended.

This means that if you have a license with strict restrictions, you can prevent users from extending the game system with those restrictions in mind.

### Versioning Accountability

When you update a license version, Nurl Sanctum will automatically validate the version of the license that is being used in the game system or extension. If the version is outdated, Nurl Sanctum will show a warning message for the user to choose to use the updated license version or continue with the outdated version.

If the license permissions or restrictions are updated, Nurl Sanctum will be able to validate the system or extension features against the new license version to ensure that the system or extension is compliant with the new license version.
