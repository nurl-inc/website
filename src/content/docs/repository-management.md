# Repository Management

## Overview

**A repository is a collection of modules for a single game.**

For example, a game like D&D 5th edition has a repository that holds modules for the core rules, the player's handbook, the monster manual, and the dungeon masters guide.

To put it simply, each game has a repository that holds all the content for that game.

## Creating a Repository

There are two ways to create a repository:

1. Create your first repository for a workspace
2. Create a new repository from a workspace with existing repositories

### Create your first repository for a workspace

To create your first repository for a workspace, click the "create repository" button in the dotted blank card in the center of the workspace.

This will send you to a page where you can enter the name, description, and the visibility of the repository you'd like to create.

Once you've submitted the form, you'll be redirected to the new repository page.

### Create a new repository from a workspace with existing repositories

To create a new repository from a workspace with existing repositories, click the "new repository" button in the top left corner of the Nurl Sanctum "All Repositories" page of the dashboard.

A dropdown menu will appear with the workspaces you're a part of. Select the workspace you'd like to create the repository in.

Once you've selected the workspace, you'll be redirected to the new repository page where you can enter the name, description, and the visibility of the repository you'd like to create.

Once you've submitted the form, you'll be redirected to the new repository page.

## Repository Visibility

Repositories can be set to one of three visibility levels:

1. Public
2. Private
3. Internal

At any time, you can change the visibility of a repository in the [repository settings](#repository-settings) page.

### Public

A public repository is visible to all users. This is a great choice for games that are open-source or have a open-license that allows other people to use the content.

If a repository is public, only the members a part of the workspace will be able to **edit** the repository. All other users will only be able to **view** the repository.

### Private

A private repository is only visible to the workspace admin. This is a great choice for someone who wants to keep track of some ideas but not share them with the public or other workspace members.

### Internal

An internal repository is visible to all members of the workspace. This is a great choice for games that have a closed-source license or are not yet ready to be released to the public.

## Repository Settings

> [!NOTE]
> Only the workspace admin can access the repository settings page.

To access the repository settings, navigate to the repository page and click the "settings" button in the bottom of the left sidebar.

This will send you to the repository settings page where you can access the general and danger zones sections.

### General

The general section contains the repository name, description, and visibility settings.

#### Repository Name

The repository name is the name of the repository that will be displayed to the any user who has access to the repository.

#### Description

The description is a short description of the repository that will be displayed to any user who has access to the repository.

### Danger Zone

The danger zone section contains the repository deletion option.

#### Delete Repository

The delete repository option will delete the repository and all of its content. This action is not reversible.
