# Dice Workshop

The Dice Workshop is the area in the system file where you can manage your dice and blocks. It contains a tabbed layout with the following tabs:

- Sets
- Analyze

## Sets

This is the area where you can register a dice set that your system will use. Additionally, this is where you can create a custom dice set if you plan on using dice that have symbols or anything other than the default numbered sides.

### Adding a Single Die

To add a single die, click the "Add Die" button. You will be see a sidebar appear on the right side of the screen. It has two sections:

- Single Die
- Die Set Template

In the Single Die section, you will need to provide the following information:

- Name
- Notation
- Description

Click the "Add Die" button to add the die to your system. Once added, you will see it in the list of the Sets tab.

### Adding a Die Set

To add a die set, click the "Add Die" button. You will be see a sidebar appear on the right side of the screen. The second section of the sidebar is the Die Set Template section.

This is a "one click" setup for quickly adding sets that are commonly used in games.

To add a die set, simply click on the die set template you want to add. Once added, you will see it in the list of the Sets tab.

## Analyze

In the Analyze tab, you can analyze the dice set you have registered with interactive tools to help you understand the probabilities of each outcome and how your dice set can affect your game system in general.

In this tab you can analyze a single die or a pool of whichever die you have selected in the menu.

### Analyze Single Die

To analyze a single die, select the die you want to analyze from the menu. Once selected, you will see the analyze tools appear on the right side of the screen.

### Analyze Pool of Dice

To analyze a pool of dice, select the die you want to analyze from the menu. You will see a list of numbers on the left side of the menu - these are your pool options. By default, "1d" is selected (for 1 die).

By clicking on a higher number, you are increasing the number of dice in your pool. For example, if you click on "2d", you will have 2 dice in your pool. This will allow you to analyze the probabilities of each outcome for a pool of dice.
