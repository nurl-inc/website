# Workspace Management

Nurl Sanctum provides an easy way to manage your workspaces.

## Overview

A workspace is a collection of projects for a single or team of users.

## Creating a Workspace

Upon signing up for Nurl Sanctum, a "personal" workspace is automatically created for you. You can create additional workspaces at any time.

To create a new workspace, click the "new Workspace" button in the top left corner of the Nurl Sanctum dashboard. This will send you to a page where you can enter the name of the workspace you'd like to create.

Once you've submitted the form, you'll be redirected to the new workspace settings page.

## Switching Workspaces

You can switch between workspaces at any time. To switch between workspaces, click the "projects" dropdown in the top left corner of the Nurl Sanctum main navigation app bar. This will display a dropdown menu of all the workspaces you're a part of.

Click the workspace you'd like to switch to and you'll be redirected to the new workspace settings page.

## Editing a Workspace

You can edit a workspace by navigating to the workspace settings page on the "general" tab. At the top of the page, you'll see a form where you can edit the name and description of the workspace.

Once you've submitted the form, the changes will be saved.

## Deleting a Workspace

You can delete a workspace by navigating to the workspace settings page on the "general" tab. At the bottom of the page, you'll see a "danger zone" section.

In this section, you'll see a "delete workspace" button. Clicking this button will send a confirmation dialog to the workspace owner.

Once confirmed, the workspace will be deleted and you'll be redirected to the Nurl Sanctum dashboard.

**Note:** _This action is irreversible. Deleting a workspace will also delete all the projects and data associated with it._
