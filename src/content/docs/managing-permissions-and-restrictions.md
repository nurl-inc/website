# Managing Permissions and Restrictions

Licenses are a way to manage the usage of your game systems. Each license is associated with a verified publisher.

> [!NOTE]
> While Nurl Sanctum allows helps you to manage licenses, we are not a license management company. We always recommend using a legal counsel to help you establish your license agreements first.

## Overview

When you create a license, you will need to create the permissions and restrictions for the license.

## Creating Permissions

On the license page, you will see a "Permissions" section. Here you will be able to create, edit, and delete permissions for the license.

You will see a "Add Permission" button that will allow you to create a new permission for the license. Clicking this button will take you to the permission creation page.

### What makes a good permission?

Think of permissions as the actions that a user can do with the license. For example, if you are a game system publisher, you may want to allow users to use your game system in a commercial way.

A permission is a combination of three fields:

- **Permission Type** - The type of permission.
- **Permission Description** - An easy to understand description of the permission.
- **Permission Condition** - The condition that must be met for the permission to be valid.

You would create a permission called "Commercial Use" and then add the permission that the user is allowed to create commercial derivative works with the game system.

Once you have created the permission, you will be redirected back to the license page where you will see the permission you just created.

### Editing Permissions

You can edit a permission by clicking the "Edit Permissions" button in the top right corner of the permission section. This will take you to the permission edit page.

Here you will be able to edit the permission details.

### Deleting Permissions

You can delete a permission by clicking the "trash icon" button at the end of the permission row. Clicking this button will show a confirmation modal.

Here you will be able to delete the permission once you have entered the confirmation text and clicked the confirmation button.

## Creating Restrictions

The process of creating restrictions is the same as creating permissions. You will see a "Restrictions" section on the license page. Here you will be able to create, edit, and delete restrictions for the license.

### What makes a good restriction?

Think of restrictions as the actions that a user should not do with the license. For example, if you are a game system publisher, you may want to prevent users from using your game system in a way that is not allowed by the license.

A restriction is a combination of two fields:

- **Restricted Content** - The content that is restricted.
- **Restriction Description** - An easy to understand description of the restriction.

We recommend avoiding jargon and technical terms when creating restrictions. Instead, we recommend using simple and easy to understand language.
