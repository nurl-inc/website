# Current Work

## Overview

The current work is a way to see all the work that is currently in progress for a game system. This is useful for seeing what is currently being worked on and for getting an idea of the progress of the work.

## Accessing the Current Work

To access the current work, navigate to the repository dashboard and click the "Current Work" link in the left sidebar.

This will take you to a view off all the "branches" that are currently in progress for the game system. A branch is essentially a fork of the main game system where someone is "committing" changes to it for the purpose of eventually publishing (i.e. merging) it back into the main game system.

A Repository can have multiple branches. Branches have multiple commits.

This is useful for seeing a "bird's eye view" of the work that is currently in progress for a game system where the "History" view is more focused on each individual change published to the main game system.

## Branch Types

There are two types of branches:

- **Main** - This is the main branch of the game system. It is the default branch and is the branch that is used to publish the game system. You cannot delete or modify the main branch. It is by all means "protected".
- **Feature** - This is a branch that is used to work on a new feature for the game system. Any changes that are in progress are stored in a feature branch.

## Main Branch

The main branch is the default branch of the game system. It is the branch that is used to essentially "publish" the game system. This is the branch that you will take the final version of your game system and publish to the public by whichever means you choose.

## Feature Branches

Feature branches are used to work on a new feature for the game system. Any changes that are in progress are stored in a feature branch.
