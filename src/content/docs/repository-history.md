# Repository History

## Overview

The repository history is a way to track the changes that have been made to game content within a repository. This is useful for understanding the evolution of a repository and for seeing who made the changes.

## Accessing the Repository History

To access the repository history, navigate to the repository dashboard and click the "History" link in the left sidebar.

## History Types

Depending on the change made to a game content item, the history entry will be different. Think of the history as a log of changes (i.e. commits) that have been made to the game system.

- **Added** - A new change has been added to the repository.
- **Modified** - Something has been modified in the repository.
- **Deleted** - Something has been deleted from the repository.
- **Renamed** - Something has been renamed in the repository.
- **Moved** - Something has been moved in the repository.
- **Formatted** - Something has been formatted in the repository.
- **Metadata Changed** - The metadata of the repository has been changed.

## History Entries

Each history entry will have the following information:

- **Commit Message** - The message of the commit.
- **Commit Hash** - The hash of the commit.
- **Commit Date** - The date of the commit.
- **Commit Author** - The author of the commit.
- **Commit Type** - The type of commit.
- **Commit Summary** - A summary of the changes made in the commit.

## Why is this important?

The repository history is important because it allows you to see the changes that have been made to game content within a repository. This is useful for understanding the evolution of a repository and for seeing who made the changes.

## How is this useful?

The repository history is useful for a few reasons:

- **Understanding the Evolution of a Game System** - By seeing the changes that have been made to a game system, you can understand the evolution of the game system.
- **Seeing Who Made the Changes** - By seeing the author of the changes, you can see who made the changes and get an idea of their expertise.
- **Understanding the Changes** - By seeing the commit message, you can understand the changes that were made.

## Example

Let's say you are working on a game system for over a year and something has not evolved as you hoped. You remember that your original idea for a new mechanic was published a few months ago (i.e. it was at it's purest form).

You can navigate to the repository history and see the original commit and choose to revert to that version to start fresh.
