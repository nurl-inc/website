# Authentication

Simple authentication for all your Nurl accounts.

## Overview

Nurl uses a one-time login token (OTP) to authenticate users. This OTP is sent to the user's email address and is valid for a single use and a limited time of 1 hour.

## Synchronization

When you create an account with Nurl Sanctum or Play, your account will be synchronized across all Nurl services. This means that you can login to any Nurl service with the same credentials.

## Security

Because Nurl uses a one-time login token (OTP), your account automatically provides the highest level of security without the need for a password or an additional authentication provider.

## Creating an Account

To create an account, simply "sign in" to the Nurl product you'd like to use. Our authentication will recognize that you don't have an account yet and will create one for you.

**Each Nurl product uses the same sign in process.**

After you enter your email address, you'll receive a one-time login token (OTP) via email. This OTP is valid for a single use and a limited time of 1 hour.

Once you've entered the OTP you have received, you'll be officially logged in and redirected to the Nurl product you'd like to use.

You can sign in to Nurl products using the name of the product as the subdomain for the nurl.app domain. For example, if you'd like to sign in to Nurl Sanctum, you can use the following URL:

[https://sanctum.nurl.app](https://sanctum.nurl.app)

## Signing In

**Signing in is the same as creating an account.** Simply enter your email address and you'll receive a one-time login token (OTP) via email. This OTP is valid for a single use and a limited time of 1 hour.

Once you've entered the OTP you have received, you'll be officially logged in and redirected to the Nurl product you'd like to use.

## Signing Out

Signing out is just as easy as signing in. Simply click the "Sign Out" button in the top right corner of the Nurl product you're using.

## Forgot Your Email Address?

If you forgot your email address you can sign up with a new email address and we can link your accounts on your behalf. Once you've signed up with a new email address contact us at <admin@nurlttrpg.com> and we can link your accounts on your behalf.
