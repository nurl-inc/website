# Organizations

Organizations symbolize a user or group of users who are associated with an account. Organizations can be used to group repositories and manage access to them.

## Creating an Organization

> Upon account creation, Sanctum will create an organization for you. In addition to this, you may create additional organizations or join existing organizations.

To create an organization, navigate to the Organization breadcrumb menu located in the top app bar, directly next to the dice logo. Click on the arrow button to open the menu and select "Create Organization". This will send you to a page where you can enter the name, description, and the visibility of the organization you'd like to create.

## Joining an Organization

Joining organizations is through invite only. Once someone invites you to an organization, you will receive an email with a link to join the organization. Click the link to join the organization.

## Managing an Organization

The organization settings page is located in the side nav under the "Organizations" section. Here you will be able to manage your organization, including adding members, removing members, and updating the organization's settings.

### Adding Members

To add a member to your organization, navigate to the "Members" tab on the organization settings page. Here you will be able to search for a user by their email address and add them to your organization. You will also be able to remove members or edit their roles from your organization here.

> Note: You can only see invited members in your organization table who are users of Sanctum. If you invite someone who is not a user of Sanctum, they will not be visible in your organization table until they accept the email invitation.

### Removing Members

To remove a member from your organization, navigate to the "Members" tab on the organization settings page. At the end of the row for the member you'd like to remove, you will see a "Remove" button. Click this button to remove the member from your organization.

You will be prompted to confirm your action. Click "Remove" to confirm. This will permanently remove the member from your organization and revoke their access to all repositories in your organization.

> Note: This history will remain in your organization table for reference.

### Updating Organization Settings

To update an organization's settings, navigate to the "General" tab on the organization settings page. Here you will be able to update the organization's name, description, and visibility.

#### Deleting an Organization

To delete an organization, navigate to the "General" tab on the organization settings page and scroll down to the "danger zone" section. Here you will be able to delete the organization. You will be prompted to confirm your action. Click "Delete" to confirm. This will permanently delete the organization and all of its repositories.

> Note: Be careful when deleting an organization as this action cannot be undone. If you have any public repositories in your organization, they will be deleted as well. We recommend assigning new owners and leaving the organization before deleting it.
