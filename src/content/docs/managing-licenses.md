# Managing Licenses

Licenses are a way to manage the usage of your game systems. Each license is associated with a verified publisher.

> [!NOTE]
> While Nurl Sanctum allows helps you to manage licenses, we are not a license management company. We always recommend using a legal counsel to help you establish your license agreements first.

## Overview

Once you have created a custom license, you will be able to manage it.

There are three parts to a custom license in Nurl Sanctum:

- **General** - The general information about the license.
- **Permissions** - The permissions that the license allows.
- **Restrictions** - The restrictions that the license imposes.

## General

The general section is where you will be able to manage the general information about the license.active

This includes (but is not limited to):

- **License Name** - The name of the license.
- **License Summary** - A short non-technical summary of the license.
- **License Version** - The version of the license.
- **License Source URL** - The URL to the source of the license.
- **License Full Text** - The full text of the license (e.g. the license agreement itself).

## Permissions

The permissions section is where you will be able to manage the permissions that the license allows.

Permissions are not required for a license to be valid. However, they are a way to manage the usage of the license.

Read our guide on [managing permissions and restrictions](./managing-permissions-and-restrictions) for more information.

## Restrictions

The restrictions section is where you will be able to manage the restrictions that the license imposes.

Restrictions are not required for a license to be valid. However, they are a way to manage the usage of the license.

Read our guide on [managing permissions and restrictions](./managing-permissions-and-restrictions) for more information.

## Editing General Information

To edit the general information about the license, you will need to click the "Edit General Information" button in the top right corner of the general section.

This will take you to the general information edit page.

Here you will be able to edit the general information about the license.

Once you have made your changes, you will need to click the "Save" button in the bottom of the form.

This will save the changes and redirect you back to the license page.

## Deleting a License

At the bottom of the license page, you will see a section called "Danger Zone".

Here you will see a "Delete License" button.

Clicking this button will show a confirmation modal.

Here you will need to enter the name of the license to confirm the deletion.

Once you have entered the name of the license and clicked the "Delete" button, the license will be deleted.

This action is irreversible.

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting a license will delete all associated permissions and restrictions and affect any game systems that use the license. We recommend to avoid deleting licenses unless absolutely necessary.
