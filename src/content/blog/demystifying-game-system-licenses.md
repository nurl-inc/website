# Demystifying Game System Licenses: How Nurl Sanctum's License Assistant Empowers TTRPG Publishers

In the vibrant world of tabletop role-playing games, creating and publishing your own game system can be an exhilarating journey. But there's one aspect that often causes even the most seasoned designers to pause: licensing.

If you've ever found yourself lost in the labyrinth of legal jargon or wondering how to properly protect your creative work while still fostering community engagement, you're not alone. Today, we're excited to introduce a game-changing feature that addresses these challenges head-on: **Nurl Sanctum's License Assistant**.

## The License Conundrum: What Publishers Face Today

The tabletop RPG industry has seen tremendous growth, with the global market projected to reach $5.27 billion by 2033. With this expansion comes an increasing number of independent publishers looking to share their creative visions with the world.

However, several challenges consistently plague the licensing process:

1.**Legal Complexity**: Traditional licenses are often written in dense legalese that requires specialized knowledge to fully understand.

2.**Communication Barriers**: Conveying what users can and cannot do with your game system is surprisingly difficult when relying solely on standard license text.

3.**Version Management**: As licenses evolve over time, keeping track of changes and ensuring users are aware of updates can become a logistical nightmare.

4.**Accountability**: Without proper systems in place, it's nearly impossible to track how your game system is being used or extended by others.

5.**User Comprehension**: Even when licenses are clear to you, ensuring your users actually understand the permissions and restrictions remains challenging.
