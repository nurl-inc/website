# Introducing Nurl Sanctum

This year we have big goals to help empower our game designers and publishers with [Nurl Sanctum](https://nurlttrpg.com/sanctum).

Sanctum allows teams (no matter if you are solo or well-known) to have a safe and version-controlled space to build, validate, test, and iterate games faster.

## Version Control

This concept comes from software development via "Git" that creates a historical record of every contribution to a codebase. If there is contribution that conflicts with the original source of truth (the main/published code), it helps to bring that to your attention before you merge it into the published code base.

Sanctum brings this feature into the TTRPG space and automates the process so you don't have to understand version control. This empowers designers to build safely with a historical record of what they did when in case something needs to be reversed.

## Validation

Sanctum will also introduce validating game features via automation with each publishable update. What this looks like at a high level is a designer setting up a "test" for X feature and Nurl Sanctum ensuring it doesn't become OP at a higher level.

This will be a game changer for our industry and the great people who are responsible for building the games we love.

## Testing

Similar to the validation, Sanctum will also allow designers to run automated tests (or create manual ones) with each publishable update that ensure the stability of your game content.

For example, a there might be a test that ensures "GameX" always has a "Y-Weapon" that scales to "basic-legendary" modes. If a new member joins the team and removes that weapon without understanding the consequences - it will be caught in the test.

In theory, this allows designers & publishers to have a 3-level safety-net:

- Level 1: version control displays the difference that is going to be published
- Level 2: validation fails if there is a test for that item
- Level 3: test for that item fails because it is now missing

## Integration Testing

Sanctum will also offer designers & publishers to integrate with Nurl Play, our Consumer product that allows IRL players to have an group-level app which provides video-game like automation without stealing the spotlight from the table.

If a publisher integrates with Play, their game data will be instantly available to players to test out. Play will also report usage analytics to the Sanctum account so the designer can make any last minute adjustments before publishing publicly.

## What's Next?

We are excited to see what our community will build with Sanctum and are looking forward to seeing the games that will be created.
