# About Nurl

## Our Mission

To enhance tabletop gaming while preserving what makes it special: the physical experience and social magic that happens around the table.

## Our Story

Every great innovation starts with a problem. Ours began at a game table, watching players pause mid-story to look up rules, calculate modifiers, and track multiple states. We saw how these interruptions broke the immersion and flow of otherwise incredible gaming moments.

We were those players.

As TTRPG players ourselves, we knew there had to be a better way â€“ one that didn't force a choice between the tactile joy of rolling dice and the convenience of digital tools. We envisioned a future where technology enhanced the tabletop experience without replacing its soul.

## What We Built

### Nurl Play

We created Nurl Play to handle the complex while you handle the epic. It's like having a video game's automation with the freedom of tabletop play. Roll your dice, move your minis, and let Nurl handle the rest.

### Nurl Sanctum

For publishers, we built Sanctum as the sacred space where games take shape. It transforms the game development process with visual tools that let creators see and test their entire game system at a glance.

## Our Values

### Enhance, Don't Replace

We believe in technology that amplifies the tabletop experience without diminishing what makes it special.

### Community First

Every feature we build starts with our community. We're players and publishers building for players and publishers.

### Open Creation

We support creators of all sizes, from solo developers to established studios, with tools that make game development more accessible and efficient.
