# About Nurl

## Our Mission

To enhance the tabletop RPG industry from top to bottom while preserving what makes it special: the physical experience and social magic that happens around the table.

## Our Story

Every great innovation starts with a problem. Ours began at a game table, watching players pause mid-story to look up rules, calculate modifiers, and track multiple states. We saw how these interruptions broke the immersion and flow of otherwise incredible gaming moments.

We were those players.

As TTRPG players ourselves, we knew there had to be a better way â€“ one that didn't force a choice between the tactile joy of rolling dice and the convenience of digital tools. We envisioned a future where technology enhanced the tabletop experience without replacing its soul.

In starting this journey, we realized that game designers were also lacking the tools they needed to create and scale their games. This was an industry-wide problem that needed to be solved.

## What We Are Building

### Nurl Sanctum

For game designers and studios, we are building Sanctum as the sacred space where games take shape. It is the platform for game designers to create, scale, collaborate, and validate their games with the community.

Using modern tools and workflows (without AI) that other industries have been using for decades, Sanctum provides TTRPG specific tooling to help designers accomplish anything from ideation to validation.

Additionally, Sanctum naturally creates a community where designers can follow, share, and import other systems and content to build their own games.

### Nurl Play

For IRL groups, we are creating Nurl Play to handle the complex while you handle the epic. It's like having a video game's automation with the freedom of tabletop play. Roll your dice, move your minis, and let Nurl handle the rest (all without AI).

Since designers are using Sanctum to create their games, Nurl Play is able to provide a "play testing" experience that is unmatched by any other tool. As soon as a designer marks a file "ready for testing", users will get a notification to try it out.

## Our Values

### Enhance, Don't Replace

We believe in technology that amplifies the tabletop experience without diminishing what makes it special. We are not a video game company, but we do believe in video game-like automation.

We believe in building products without AI.

We believe designers deserve high-quality tools to create and scale their games in a collaborative way that enhances and grows the community.

### Community First

Every feature we build starts with our community. We're players and designers building for players and designers. Every feature shipped is a result of deep thinking and validation from real players and designers first.

### Open Creation

We support creators of all sizes, from solo developers to established studios, with tools that make game development more accessible and efficient.
